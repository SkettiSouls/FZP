<h2 align="center">FZP - Bash Edition</h2>

### The very first iteration of FZP
this is the first ever attempt and implementation of my fuzzy finding music player,
with the git history as a rebase of my **[bin]** repo.

Running this script requires **[mpv]** and **[fzf]**. <br>
This script functions as intended, but does not attempt to manage dependencies for you.
