<h2 align="center">FuZzy Player</h2>

### This was my first attempt at porting my bash """music player""" to rust.
I attempted this rewrite with next to no real programming experience 
(less than 20 total hours researching/writing bash, and very sub-par nix),
and was put on hold while I decided to focus on nix and work.

Upon returning to this codebase with a bit more experience
(5 months of near daily non-configuration nix commits),
I realized all the code is shit and decided to restart (see master branch).

This branch will be left as an archive of my first attempt at a compiled language.
